STMicroelectronics STM32 Platforms Device Tree Bindings

Each device tree must specify which STM32 SoC it uses,
using one of the following compatible strings:

  st,stm32f429
  st,stm32f469
  st,stm32f746
  st,stm32h743
  st,stm32mp157

Required nodes:

- syscon: some subnode of the STM32 SoC node must be a
  system controller node pointing to the control registers,
  with the compatible string set to one of these tuples:
  "st,stm32-syscfg", "syscon"
