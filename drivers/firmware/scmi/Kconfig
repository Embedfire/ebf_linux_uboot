	  System Control and Management Interface (SCMI) is a communication
	  protocol that defines standard interfaces for power, performance
	  and system management. The SCMI specification is available at
	  https://developer.arm.com/architectures/system-architectures/software-standards/scmi

	  An SCMI agent communicates with a related SCMI server firmware
	  located in another sub-system, as a companion micro controller
	  or a companion host in the CPU system.

	  Communications between agent (client) and the SCMI server are
	  based on message exchange.
